# CLI Roadmap

A future CLI will provide an artisan-like developer experience:

Ideas:
- `altarie new <name>` — scaffold a new app
- `altarie make:controller <Name>` — generate controller
- `altarie make:migration <Name>` — generate migration
- `altarie serve` — run development server

Implementation direction:
- Use Commander.js
- Ship as a `bin` in npm package
